# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews

This project aims to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning and deep learning
techniques. By analyzing the textual content of the reviews, we build models that can accurately predict the sentiment
expressed by the reviewer.

We utilize the [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), which consists of 50,000
reviews evenly divided between positive and negative sentiments. The project explores various models, including Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, a Simple Neural Network with Embedding Layers, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and a Long
Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM). Through this exploration, we aim to identify the most effective approach for sentiment
analysis in this context.
